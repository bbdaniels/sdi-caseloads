#######################
# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# Keep markdown files used for documentation on GitHub
!README.md
!CONTRIBUTING.md
!reproot.yaml

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.

# Include some additional file formats in any output folder. You might have
# to change the name of the Output folder to whatever it is called in your
# project, but we strongly recommend that you only include these files in
# a subset of the folders where you are certain no private data is ever stored.

!/**/*.txt
!/**/*.png
!/**/*.csv
!/**/*.xml
!/**/*.eps
!/**/*.svg

#######################
# Include all the files with passwords or tokens here. All files named
# password or passwords are with this template ignored no matter which
# format you are using. Additionally, all content in any folder called
password or passwords are also ignored. NOTE that your project might be
using different names and then you must edit the lines below accordingly.
